# Transmitter Code for Hand Gesture Controlled Robot Car

This code runs on the **Arduino NANO** and reads data from the **MPU 6050** accelerometer. It sends motor control commands (`F`, `B`, `L`, `R`, `S`) to the receiver via serial communication.

### Components
- Arduino NANO
- MPU 6050 (Accelerometer + Gyroscope)

### Wiring
- Connect MPU 6050 to NANO using I2C (SDA, SCL).
- Connect NANO to the receiver (UNO) via serial communication.

### Usage
1. Upload the code to the NANO.
2. Ensure the receiver is ready to accept commands.
